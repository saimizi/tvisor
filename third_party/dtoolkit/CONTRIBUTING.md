## Before you begin

### Sign our Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a
[Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about) (CLA).
You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply
gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the

## Contribution process

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

### Unsafe code policy

* The use of `unsafe` code is generally disallowed. The Device Tree parser
  must validate all input data, treating it as untrusted. This includes bounds
  checking for all offsets and indices to prevent vulnerabilities.
* Should a compelling justification arise for the inclusion of `unsafe` code
  (beyond performance optimization) it must be accompanied by
  an `#[expect(unsafe_code)]` attribute, stating the rationale.
* All `unsafe` code must be tested. The CI suite includes Miri to detect any
  undefined behavior.

## Releasing a new version

This project uses [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org/) to generate changelogs.
When releasing a new version, run:

```
git-cliff --unreleased --tag <version>
```

(where `<version>` is the version number to be released)

Append the output to the `CHANGELOG.md` file and make changes if necessary.

Note that in order for this to work properly, the commit messages must follow
[Conventional Commits](https://git-cliff.org/docs/#how-should-i-write-my-commits).
